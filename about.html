            <p>Long queues are a big problem in many places like hospitals, government offices, banks, and colleges. People have to stand for hours without knowing when their turn will come.</p>
            
            <h3>Main Problems:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time Wastage:</strong> People waste 2-4 hours just standing in lines</li>
                <li><strong>No Information:</strong> Nobody knows how long they have to wait</li>
                <li><strong>Physical Difficulty:</strong> Standing for long time is hard for elderly people and pregnant women</li>
                <li><strong>Frustration:</strong> People get angry and stressed because of uncertainty</li>
                <li><strong>Crowding:</strong> Too many people in small waiting areas</li>
